**Data Forge Fusion** is a versatile toolkit designed for **data conversion, cleaning, analysis, and visualization**. It supports various file formats including XML, CSV, Parquet, Excel, and JSON, allowing for seamless conversions. With integrated features like data previewing, merge capabilities, file compression, detailed data summaries, duplicate detection, and custom plot creation, it simplifies data manipulation tasks, making it a go-to application for data enthusiasts.

## Steam Sentiment Analysis

**My Steam Sentiment Analysis** project analyzes user reviews on Steam to uncover detailed player sentiments beyond the platform's basic positive/negative classification. By examining individual reviews, it provides nuanced insights into what players truly think about games, offering a more accurate and comprehensive evaluation than Steam's existing algorithm. 
- **Clustering Techniques**: 
  - Implements **K-Means clustering** and **hierarchical clustering** to group reviews based on their underlying patterns and similarities, enabling a detailed analysis of player opinions.
- **Topic Modeling with LDA**: 
  - Utilizes **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to identify recurring themes and topics within the reviews, such as gameplay, graphics, bugs, or updates.
- Different visualizations and statistical results are provided in png and csv formats for detailed analytical results.
